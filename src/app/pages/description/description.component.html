    Summary
</h2>

<p class="text-md-3">
    This is an Angular project created via Angular Cli. It uses all standard functionality including Lint validation and Unit tests.
    <br />All requirements from the description of the exercise have been replied.

    Known issues
</h2>
<p class="text-md-3">
    On certain view dimensions, you can see that full-width alignment of the latest row looks not appropriate.
    <br />In the real application, I would suggest finding a proper way of using images (by changing the technical task), or either create an auto-alignment function where you will check the number of items fit the row and depends on this set row/column parameters. But it sounds quite "hacky", so I decided to follow the initial task and solve it with css.

    Project structure

<h3>
    SCSS
</h3>
<p class="text-md-3">
    I use bootstrap and common styles. All of them depend on a group of variables that can be included in components as well.

    General structuring was done "by feature" with "shared" folder using.
